### Plans for Planetary Data Workshop

	* Do we have a roadmap?


### Affiliated Packages
* Need Michael or Chase's approval for [PR #59](https://github.com/planetarypy/TC/pull/59) to delete the Affiliated package stuff from the TC repo.  It already lives in its new home under the planetarypy.github.io repo.

* `craterstats` has been [submitted](https://github.com/planetarypy/planetarypy.github.io/pull/5),
  review will be delayed until author is ready, see PR.
  * Greg is writing a lot of tests: https://github.com/ggmichael/craterstats/commits/main
  * When he's ready, he needs to let us know to "restart" the rerview.
  * Action is on Greg when he's ready.
  * Currently at 64% test coverage.  Should we reach out?  Is that enough to restart?  Goes back to what we think the "bar" is for test coverage.
