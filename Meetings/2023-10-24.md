## Participants
- Michael Aye (MA)

## Open AIs
- Craterstats affiliation: MA emailed author of `craterstats` to please accept the PR for improved installation instructions
  - It's maybe worthwhile to note that the package has already 21 GH stars which is more than `pvl` interestingly.
  - Just saying that this possibly "proves" the usefulness to the community?
- planetarypy core has seen some commits to update its skeleton and a config module.

## Agenda

### `pdr` application as affiliated package

### skeleton files updates / cookiecutters

- interestingly, there's not a single cookiecutter that does "most" things right (IMHO).
- Only found one cookiecutter that uses pyproject.toml without using it b/c of use of poetry
- Only a very barebone cookiecutter template I found uses the src/<libname> layout
- The Hypermodern cookiecutter is very interesting for setup of several automatisms, but almost does too much and uses poetry.
- I decided that my time is better spent in putting the library together than to decide right now for the best package infrastructure.
