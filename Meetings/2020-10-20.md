## Agenda

### Outstanding action items from last time

* RB: Add "SPICE" dialect to `pvl`
    - Decided to no-op: Turns out that SPICE text kernels have several
	  other departures from the PVL specification, and it just isn't 
      appropriate to have that in the `pvl` library.  One could write a
      relatively simple library that depended on `pvl` for most of the heavy
      lifting to do this.

* MA: Push template with src layout up
* MA: Set up GH action for tag based pypi upload of `pvl`

### Status of `pvl` application?
	* Application PR: [#28](https://github.com/planetarypy/TC/pull/28)

### Continue discussion of first steps for core
* focus on "data access" first, don't make data management perfect
