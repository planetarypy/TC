## Agenda

### Outstanding action items from last time

* RB: Add "SPICE" dialect to `pvl`
    - Decided to no-op: Turns out that SPICE text kernels have several
	  other departures from the PVL specification, and it just isn't 
      appropriate to have that in the `pvl` library.  One could write a
      relatively simple library that depended on `pvl` for most of the heavy
      lifting to do this.

* MA: Push template with src layout up
* MA: Set up GH action for tag based pypi upload of `pvl`

### Status of `pvl` application?
	* Application PR: [#28](https://github.com/planetarypy/TC/pull/28)

### Continue discussion of first steps for core
* focus on "data access" first, don't make data management perfect

### Initial repo setup for core
#### Some remaining questions on what cookiecutter sets up:

* requirements_dev.txt
  * it has old requirements
  * is it helpful to pinpoint versions up to patch version?
  * this file is used by tox, e.g.

#### License
Does it matter if the license holder is "PlanetaryPy" or "PlanetaryPy developers"

#### Black requirement
How to require black formatting?

#### Good workflow for TDD?
If design/UI requirements are kept track as broken tests, is it satisfactory to not ever have unbroken tests?
Should we keep requirements elsewhere and add them as tests when development on them starts for real?
