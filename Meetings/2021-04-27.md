  * MA submitted a great abstract on PlanetaryPy

  * Ross submitted one for pvl

3 abstracts related to PlaPY, nice!
* Do we want to reach out to PDW organizers to hold some activity or something at the PDW?
  * AI (MA): Contact Trent what the status is for extra activities around PDW?

### Affiliated Packages
* `kalasiris` has been [submitted](https://github.com/planetarypy/TC/pull/49), AA is review manager.
  * 1st reviewer candidate not available
  * USGS candidate replied that they are not using kalasiris.

* `craterstats` has been [submitted](https://github.com/planetarypy/planetarypy.github.io/pull/5),
  review will be delayed until author is ready, see PR.
  * Ross worked with Greg to iron out some structure issues with the repo
    * In prep for setuptools, imports were cleaned up.
  * Application still blocked on lack of tests.
    * Tests are slowly popping up.  
    * code base in current state looks difficult to be built upon as a library
    * The planetarypy project doesn't require this though, so, this is fine.
    * If the need arises for someone to make use of it, somebody will implement it
    * We certainly do not have the capacity to re-code this.
