# Previous meeting's action times
* MA: Rename planetarypy to get it out of way for seen as core.
  * Done. Removed from the org)
* RB: Will put document PR to the TC repo
  * #6, see below
* All: Read how astropy is organizing itself.
* All: Requirements on packages to be an affiliated package (look at astropy?)
* MA: Create issue about formal invite text
  * Created #12 instead, to keep it simple.

# Request for TC membership
Just to have things on record, I created a GH issue where interested parties should comment on if they wish to become a member of the TC. More info at the issue:
https://github.com/planetarypy/TC/issues/12

# Governance documents

Ross created a huge PR (thanks!) here: https://github.com/planetarypy/TC/pull/6) that was reviewed by KMA and AA and is now merged.
The TC members should look through to check for agreement, if not done already during the PR review time.
* One of the more important things that these documents set in place -- and the TC needs to be aware of -- is, that we need 2 reviewers and a minimum wait time before merge on changes to governing documents from now on. See documents for details.
* Motion: I think our welcoming README.md (https://github.com/planetarypy/TC) could be improved a bit (but not much, we don't want to duplicate governing documents). What do people think? I'm thinking of

# Procedure documents

Ross created another PR related to procedures within PlanetaryPy, specifically regarding affiliated packages (https://github.com/planetarypy/TC/pull/9 , now merged, Thanks, Ross!).
* If not yet done, the TC members should review for agreement.
* Questions from KMA:
  * Is it okay for a project to have open PRs during review? What if they are substantial? I'm inclined to say it doesn't matter but wanted to raise the question.
  * Should we require a conda package (at least on a private channel) from affiliated packages? If we provide the cookiecutter template for it, it shouldn't be too hard. My inclination is that we should for now, but we could revisit this if it creates too much of a hurdle for people. Or, the TC decides to help authors with these issue?

# Steps toward a core packagee

Because the TC decided last meeting that the package should be started from scratch, there are a multitude of things to decide.
* KMA tried to summarize these in a GH project here, and suggests to go through the itemized checklist for a bit during the telecon:
  * https://github.com/planetarypy/TC/projects/1

One of the suggested ways forward (https://github.com/planetarypy/TC/issues/3) is to prepare one of the grandfathered PlanetaryPy projects for becoming an affiliated package (meaning lower requirements than the core package). We have now documented guidelines for this process in the `Procedures` directory.
* We were previously naming `pvl` as a candidate for this process, but it has currently open issues and PR's, could Trevor Olson comment on these and related workloads?

Another step towards a core package is to create a cookiecutter package that places all required items where they should be, including a conda package template.
* We currently have already a cookiecutter package in the GH org, we would need to update it with the things that have changed. KMA is happy to lead this effort as he has a more up-to-date cookiecutter package focusing available.
  * Related to this, it is good to finally have a `tox-conda` plugin that will enable us to create test matrices while fully supporting conda, which was not combinable in the past.

  # AOB?
