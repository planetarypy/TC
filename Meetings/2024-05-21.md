## Agenda

### Report from NASA Software Workshop

- Ross and Andrew met Julie from [PyHC](https://heliopython.org) and learned a lot about how they got started and how they are currently operating.

- This was a good meeting and really ranged over a lot of general software topics at NASA.


### craterstats

- Affiliate Package application withdrawn at author's request, [PR closed](https://github.com/planetarypy/planetarypy.github.io/pull/5).

- If we ever have just a list of packages without any qualifications, that's all that the craterstats author wants.


### Incubation docs

- PR is still open: [https://github.com/planetarypy/TC/pull/98](https://github.com/planetarypy/TC/pull/98)
    - Comments from Christian that need to be addressed.
    - He couldn't push to PR, maybe need to review access info.

### Core package PR status

- The spice module <https://github.com/planetarypy/planetarypy/pull/11> remains open.
- When this PR lands, the repo will be transitioned to "public" access.


### TWSC Status

- TWSC : extended outline exists, but no other progress

    - RB: remove it.
