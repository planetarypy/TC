### Only 1 Approval is needed for PRs in this directory!

If a PR changes only files in this directory, only a single approval
is needed (rather than the usual two).  This allows meeting notes
to be entered quickly, and agenda items to be added by only needing
two people (the author and one approver) instead of three.
