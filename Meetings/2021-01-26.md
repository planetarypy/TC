### pvl discussion

* Github Actions now [merged](https://github.com/planetarypy/pvl/pull/76) for `pvl`.
* The TravisCI Webhook can now be deactivated, but Ross doesn't have permissions.
* [publish-to-test-pypi.yml runs too much?](https://github.com/planetarypy/pvl/issues/77)


### SpiceyPy discussion

* [SpiceyPy application submitted](https://github.com/planetarypy/TC/pull/44), and
  under review (@rbeyer is coordinator).
* External review solicited and provided.
* Expect to publish combined review once the 
  [Requirements Updates PR](https://github.com/planetarypy/TC/pull/46) is 
  resolved.

  
### https://planetarypy.github.io/

* Probably need to work on this next.
* There was some outcry against Jekyll, but we're not doing anything complicated,
  and Ross has updates (in offline local repo) that could be PRed soon.
* Go with that, or try and invent something new?
