# Agenda

## Open action times

- what's the status with the incubation packages docs draft PR?

- [https://github.com/planetarypy/TC/pull/98](https://github.com/planetarypy/TC/pull/98)

- I guess can be merged?

    - Verdict: Let's merge

## Open code of conduct issue

[https://github.com/planetarypy/TC/issues/106](https://github.com/planetarypy/TC/issues/106)

Should fix this. (Missing point of contact)

- Verdict: Let's discuss in this GH issue

    - public issue is maybe sensitive at first

    - need email? Thomas suggest groups.io as a solution



## Demo of peppi

[https://nasa-pds.github.io/peppi/](https://nasa-pds.github.io/peppi/)

Thomas Loubrieu wants to demo the PDS search API

- not enough folks for full presentation maybe?

- iterated on offline index abilities before Thomas presented a bit

-  presentation by Thomas with comments from Jordan

    - use cases can be submitted to peppi GH issues (I believe?)

    - library is meant to be a community service able to create simpler wrappers around the hard-to-remember PDS4 syntax

        - e.g. `products.has_target("mercury")`

## Core progress

- focusing on getting indexes more complete

    - a.k.a better do fewer features right than more half-baked.

- adding example notebooks that guide through the existing APIs
