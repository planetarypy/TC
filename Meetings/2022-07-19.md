## Agenda

* Michael has arrived in Germany
* Next steps for craterstats

### Michael in Germany
* Should find a different meeting time
* Andrew mentioned Friday mornings would work
* However, that falls on Friday afternoon in Europe, which is a popular travel time.
* Michael's action to create a poll

### craterstats python / Greg Michaels
* Greg confirmed that there are no other users, potentially because there's a setup issue
* MA just contacted Greg to meet up, as I'm working at his former institute now, and he should be around sometimes
* We were worried that Greg might have left science and would not spend any time on craterstats, even for minor maintenance.
* However, during the meeting Greg confirmed that that isn't the case and he's interested in fixing the setup and getting it out there.
* We agree to continue with the process of reviewing craterstats after the setup issues are fixed
  * Note: MA writes these notes too late, this is what he remembers.
