 # Procedure for the proposal, review, and acceptance of PlanetaryPy-affiliated packages

This document describes the procedure for proposing, reviewing, and making a
decision about PlanetaryPy-affiliated packages. This is meant as a record of the
PlanetaryPy procedure and eventually we'll have more detailed instructions on
proposing an affiliated package, like [Astropy does](http://www.astropy.org/affiliated/index.html).

## Proposing an affiliated package

*These instructions are for affiliated package authors*

Once you believe your package is ready to be reviewed by the
PlanetaryPy Project, open a pull request to the ??
<!--[astropy.github.com](https://github.com/astropy/astropy.github.com)
repository, modifying the ``affiliated/registry.json`` file to add
details about your own package. If you are not comfortable with
git, you can do this by using [an
editor](https://github.com/astropy/astropy.github.com/edit/master/affiliated/registry.json).
If you get a message saying **You need to fork this repository to
propose changes** then click on the green button to confirm the
forking:

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/propose_fork.png" alt="fork" width="600">
</p>
-->

Copy the following template entry and fill out the
details:

    {
      "name": "Your package name",
      "maintainer": "Your name <your email address>",
      "stable": true,
      "home_url": "URL to the home page or documentation",
      "repo_url": "URL to the repository",
      "pypi_name": "PyPI name if it exists, set to an empty string otherwise",
      "description": "A few sentence description of your package",
      "coordinated": false
      "review": {
         "functionality": "To be filled out by the reviewer",
         "ecointegration": "To be filled out by the reviewer",
         "documentation": "To be filled out by the reviewer",
         "testing": "To be filled out by the reviewer",
         "devstatus": "To be filled out by the reviewer",
         "pythonver": "To be filled out by the reviewer",
         "last-updated": "To be filled out by the reviewer"
      }
    },

then add it at the top of the ``registry.json`` file, starting on line 3,
after:

    {
      "packages": [

Once this is done, under **Propose file change** you can enter a short
description for the commit then click on the green **Propose file change**
button:

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/propose_commit.png" alt="commit" width="650">
</p>

On the next screen, check the changes you made, and click on the green
**Create pull request** button:

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/propose_create_1.png" alt="create_1" width="600">
</p>

Finally, give a title to the pull request such as **Proposed affiliated
package: your package name** and include a short description of the
package, then click on **Create pull request**:

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/propose_create_2.png" alt="create_2" width="600">
</p>

Once you've done this, you're all set! The next steps are the review,
for which the results will be posted on the pull request.


## Reviewing affiliated packages

*These instructions are for coordinators and reviewers*

One of the PlanetaryPy Technical Committee (TC) members will be in
charge of the review process (not necessarily the same person for
each package). This TC member (hereafter the *coordinator*) will
find someone to carry out the main review of the package (hereafter
the *reviewer*). In this sense the role  of the coordinator is
similar to that of a journal editor.  However this is only partially
true, because the coordinator (speaking for the TC as a whole) may
add their views to the review, unlike a journal editor who is often
strictly impartial on the review itself.  The pool of available
reviewers will be anyone who has an official role on the PlanetaryPy
team.

The coordinator sends out an email to possible reviewers one at a
time to find someone who is willing to review the package, using
the template at the bottom of this document. Let them know at this
point that the coordinator will also be doing a review and synthesizing
the results into a single review. Once a reviewer accepts, the
coordinator sends them an email with detailed review instructions,
using the template at the bottom of this document. The coordinator
then leaves a message on the pull request saying:

*Thank you for proposing this package as an affiliated package! I'm
happy to confirm that your package is now under review and we'll
post the results of the review here.*

Once the reviewer has finished, they send their review back by email
to the coordinator, who then does their own review and then writes
up a review using the review template which includes a table with
badges (template at the bottom of this document). They then share
it with the other TC members to check for consensus. The review
including the final decision (accept or reject) is then posted on
the original pull request. If the package is rejected, the original
author has a month to respond to any of the points in the review,
and the coordinator may decide to change the decision.

If the package is accepted, the coordinator edits the pull request
to add the results of the review to the JSON file.  <!--Once the
continuous integration passes, the pull request is merged.--> The
pull request is then merged.

If the package is rejected, the decision is posted to the pull request, and the
pull request is closed.

### Template email with review request

Subject: Reviewing a PlanetaryPy-affiliated package submission

Dear/Hi {potential reviewer},

The PlanetaryPY project has received a request to consider the following as an
affiliated package:

Name:
Description:
Repository:
Documentation:

I am reaching out to ask whether you would be willing to review this package.

To provide some background, an affiliated package is an planetary-related
Python package that is not part of the planetarypy core package,
but is part of the PlanetaryPy Project community. Such a package
should demonstrate a commitment to PlanetaryPy’s goals of improving
reuse, interoperability, and interface standards for Python planetary
packages.

Reviewing a package involves reading over the documentation, having
a look at the code to assess for example readability (but not read
it line by line), checking how well the package is tested, as well
as assessing its integration with the PlanetaryPy and wider planetary
software ecosystem. Most packages can be reviewed within an hour
and reviews are anonymous by default. If you accept this review,
we will send you a detailed list of criteria to check for the package
as well as how to submit your review.

Could you reply to this email to let us know if you would be willing to review
this package?

Thanks!
{coordinator_name}
