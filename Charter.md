# PlanetaryPy Charter

PlanetaryPy is governed by the members of the Technical Committee (TC).

## Statement of Purpose

PlanetaryPy is a community effort to develop a core package
for planetary science in Python and foster interoperability between
Python planetary science packages.

## Responsibilities

The PlanetaryPy TC responsibilities include:

* Technical direction
* Setting release dates.
* Release quality standards.
* Project governance and process (including this policy)
* Contribution policy
* GitHub repository hosting
* Conduct guidelines
* Maintaining the list of additional Collaborators


## Membership

### Technical Committee Members

For the current list of TC members, see the [member list](Members.md).


TC seats are not time-limited.  There is no fixed size of the 
TC.  However, the expected target is between 3 and 12, to ensure adequate
coverage of important areas of expertise, balanced with the ability
to make decisions efficiently.

There is no specific set of requirements or qualifications for 
TC membership beyond these rules.

The TC may add additional members by consensus. If there
are any objections to adding any individual member, an attempt
should be made to resolve those objections following the 
Consensus Seeking Process.

A TC member may be removed from by voluntary resignation, or by
consensus of all other members.

Changes to TC membership should be posted in the agenda, and may be
suggested as any other agenda item (see "Meetings" below).

If an addition or removal is proposed during a meeting, and the full
TC is not in attendance to participate, then the addition or removal
is added to the agenda for the subsequent meeting.  This is to ensure
that all members are given the opportunity to participate in all
membership decisions.  If a TC member is unable to attend a meeting
where a planned membership decision is being made, then their consent
is assumed.

No more than half of the TC members may be affiliated with the same
employer.  If removal or resignation of a TC member, or a change of
employment by a member, creates a situation where more than half of
the membership shares an employer, then the situation must be
immediately remedied by the resignation or removal of one or more 
TC members affiliated with the over-represented employer(s).


### Collaborators

The PlanetaryPy GitHub repository is maintained by the 
TC and additional Collaborators who are added on an ongoing basis.

Individuals making significant and valuable contributions are made
Collaborators and given commit-access. These individuals
are identified by the TC and their addition as Collaborators is
discussed during the TC meeting.

Individuals who have made significant contributions and who wish
to be considered for commit-access may create an issue or contact
a TC member directly. It is not necessary to wait for a TC
member to nominate the individual.

Collaborators may opt to escalate discussion about significant or
controversial modifications to PlanetaryPy as a whole
by assigning the ***agenda*** tag to a pull request or issue. The
TC should serve as the final arbiter where required.


## Meetings

The TC meets approximately monthly via an online video teleconference
service.  A designated moderator approved by the TC runs the meeting.
Meeting notes should be published after each meeting.

Items are added to the agenda that are considered contentious or
are modifications of governance, contribution policy, TC membership,
or release process.

The intention of the agenda is not to approve or review all patches;
that should happen continuously on GitHub and be handled by the larger
group of Collaborators.

Any community member or contributor can ask that something be added to
the next meeting's agenda by logging a GitHub Issue. Any Collaborator,
TC member, or the moderator can add the item to the agenda by adding
the ***agenda*** tag to the issue.

The creation of the meeting agenda is a continuous process that
happens via pull requests on github (with or without ***agenda*** tags).

The TC may invite persons or representatives from outside of the 
TC to participate in a non-voting capacity.

The moderator is responsible for summarizing the discussion of each
agenda item and sends it as a pull request after the meeting.


## Consensus Seeking Process

The TC follows a [Consensus Seeking][consensus] decision-making model.

When an agenda item has appeared to reach a consensus the moderator
will ask, "Does anyone object?" as a final call for dissent from the
consensus.

If an agenda item cannot reach a consensus a TC member can make a
motion for either a closing vote or a vote to table the issue to the next
meeting. A majority of the TC must vote for the motion or else the 
discussion will continue.

Note that changes to TC membership require consensus. If there are any
objections to adding or removing individual members, an effort must be
made to resolve those objections. If consensus cannot be reached, a
vote may be called following the process above.
